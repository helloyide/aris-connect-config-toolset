ARIS Connect Config Toolset
===================
ARIS Connect Config Toolset is an IntelliJ plugin for creating or editing ARIS Connect XML configurations. It helps to reduce errors and accelerate the customization process. It's still under developing, the current version focuses on the view configuration, it will support more configuration in the future.

Problem
-------------
The current ARIS Connect XML configuraions are complex and error prone even with XSD validation. The UI based Self Service Configuration (SSC) is still not as powerful as the XML configuration, for new features there is also no related SSC at beginning.

Goal
-------------
The goal of this toolset is to help configuration developers to reduce the error and accelerate the customization process:
- Validation during typing, show fix suggestions.
- Build-in documentation, choose instead of typing
- Connect related items, navigation instead of text search
- Smart refactor
- (not yet done) Auto deploy and reload the configurations

Demo
-------------
Here is a short demo about the auto completion feature, it shows how easy to create a new home view:
